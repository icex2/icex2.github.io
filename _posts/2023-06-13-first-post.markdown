You have to start somewhere and it's often hard to make the first step. This blog took me a few
hours to setup and get running due to several "small" issues. But it's done, it's somewhat simple
and hopefully serves my needs.

Being around the musicgame/Bemani arcade community since 2004 and a contributor on various larger
projects in the scene over the years, e.g. bemanitools, arcana, I realized there is different kinds
of knowledge that I seem to have and others in the community don't.

I noticed questions regarding specific tech related topics keep coming back and I keep repeating
them in private chats. This way that information is not available to everyone and easily accessible.

I want to use this blog to share my knowledge that I acquired over the years instead of letting it
rot in my brain or in my private notes. Expect to see software and hardware related stuff as well as
misc things documented that I found useful or someone asked about.
