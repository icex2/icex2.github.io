## Setup notes

* Take ready to use [jekyll docker image](https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker)
  * Note that the latest does not work as well as some of the referenced ones in the readme, e.g.
    minimal, are outdated at the time of writing this
  * `4.2.0` seems to be the latest one that works
* Created [justfile](justfile) to abstract various commands for ease of use
