Been around in the musicgame/Bemani arcade community since 2004. Contributor to
various large projects in the scene for years, e.g. bemanitools, arcana.

I want to use this blog to share my knowledge that I acquired over the years
instead of letting it rot in my brain or in my private notes. Expect to see
software and hardware related stuff as well as misc things documented that I
found useful.
